# Container

A container will prevent it's content from spreading out too much.
On mobile, the container needs to have padding to prevent elements from sticking to the side of the screen. This can be achieved by setting the 'hasPadding' prop to true.

Usage

```html
<Container>
  <p>A containerized p-tag!</p>
</Container>
```

```html
<Container hasPadding="{true}">
  <p>A p-tag in a container with padding!</p>
</Container>
```
